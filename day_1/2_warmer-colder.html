<!--
    Implement a simple guessing game.
    
    The app must select a playing card from a shuffled deck.
    This card is displayed to the user.
    The user is given two buttons (higher and lower).
    Selecting either button draws the next card from the deck.
    The new card is compared to the previous card.
        If the user's guess was correct ask them to make another guess
        If the user's guess was incorrect display a message.
    
    [note] Aces are low
    [hint] Use lodash
    [optional] keep track of the users score and display it at the end
